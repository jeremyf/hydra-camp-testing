# Hydra Camp Devise Testing

This is a Rails project built with the goal of helping you write both acceptance
and unit tests. You can follow the changes to the code by reading through the
[detailed commit history of this project](/COMMIT-LOG-REVERSE.md).

## My Testing Philosophy

The Open Source ecosystem is fast-moving. Things are evolving. I write tests to

* better understand the problem I'm trying to solve
* help ease the pain of change
* improving my chances of finding problems with the changes

Therefore if I am going to use Rails, I must write tests.
